# NewtonADMM
A specialized solver for linearly constrained convex programs, derived from the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00772. 
This repository contains solvers for convex quadratic programs (CQP) and Lasso problems. Both implementations include a preconditioned semismooth Newton step and a stopping criterion based on the primal and dual ADMM residuals.
